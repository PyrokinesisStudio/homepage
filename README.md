### Adding backgrounds
1. Add image file as `.jpg` to `assets/backgrounds` directory with a filename
   conforming to the rest of the image files (last index)
2. Bump the multiplier on line 47 of `assets/script.js` so the JavaScript can
   see it

### Using custom background on website version
To do this, you simply add `?bg` at the end of the URL and define the background you want.

**Requirements**
- HTTPS

Example:
`https://alexflipnote.xyz/homepage/?bg=https://i.alexflipnote.xyz/fd20ed.jpg`
